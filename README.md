This is a simple command-line script to demonstrate a homoglyph attack. It replaces common ASCII (Latin) characters in a string with visually identical (or similar) Cyrillic characters.

This is often used in phishing attacks to create deceptive domain names or usernames.

Prerequisites: Node.js (which includes node)

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

Example of how to run:
```bash
node  file.js
